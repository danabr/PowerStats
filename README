This project contains a set of PowerShell scripts to gather statistics about when
and for how long a Windows computer has been turned on, by inspecting the system
event log. The output from all scripts is CSV-formatted which makes it easy to
create graphs with your favourite spreadsheet program.

Examples (> is the PowerShell prompt symbol):

# Get a list of all sessions
> .\sessions.ps1
# Output:
# Start,End,Length
# 2011-06-28 13:00:00,2011-06-28 14:30:00,1.5
# ...

# How many hours per day has the computer been turned on?
> .\sessions.ps1 | .\hours_per_day.ps1
# Output
# Date,Hours
# 2011-06-28,1.5
# ...

# Limit scope to ten days
> $TenDaysAgo = (Get-Date).AddDays(-10)
> .\sessions.ps1 | .\filter {$session.Start -ge $TenDaysAgo} | .\hours_per_day.ps1
